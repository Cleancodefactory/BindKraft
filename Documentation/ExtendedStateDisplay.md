# Extended display of a control/component

The mechanism described here is very simple, but serves variety of scenarios. Perhaps the best understood and fairly common one would be a scenario where the programmer wants to be able to encapsulate part of the view inside some collapsing/dropping construct that saves space in a big form. A control or even more than one component may be needed so that the user can enter/choose an entry in the form and the sub-UI needed needs serious amount of screen space. On the other hand the chosen value/entry or values/entries do not need or simple cannot be displayed with all details when the user deals withe the rest of the form. A collapsing part or drop down-like component will provide a nice way do this.

Basically there is no need of anything specific for such a task, but having a few conventions packed in interfaces make possible such constructs to be less specialized for certain content (the collapsible part) and to gradually integrate extra user-interaction functionality which will likely be overkill in a myriad of ad-hoc implementations. This is the aim of the initiative described in this document. The interfaces and classes currently available are a rather conservative beginning which will grow as the need of common functionality forin scenarios of this kind grows.
