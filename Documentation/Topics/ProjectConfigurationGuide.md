# Project construction and configuration guide

This article covers the client side perspective of the construction of a BindKraft based project from a set of BK modules and the configuration of the whole construction, individual modules and other aspects. The document attempts to emphasize how the modules can provide client side configuration in such a way that they will easily fit into different BindKraft based projects, without need to make changes to them, how to override some of their configuration from other module when necessary and so on.
