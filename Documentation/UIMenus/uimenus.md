# UI Menus

Under the umbrella name `UIMenus` and class and interface names following the same naming there is a system of elements and functionality that enables "`parts`" of applications to export much of their user interaction elements into flexible and relocatable items which can be placed and maintained elsewhere and/or interacted in more ways than any usual UI in a view or component.

THE OBVIOUS FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT "PARTS"?

Well, it depends on the programmer's decisions, but if we have to point out the typical cases, these will be views and groups of views and under certain conditions - components. Actually anything can be pushed to an `UIMenu`, but if this makes sense or not depends on two factors - what do you do with the menus and how do you structure your components, views and windows.

The philosophy behind the UIMenu BindKraft functionality is discussed in [UI Menus concepts](UIMenusConcepts.md). It is a recommended first read, regardless of the fact that it contains no code or actual examples.
