# DataTypes

As a old school Javascript library BindKraft is not strict about types. However, many components and features need a contract about the data they exchange.

This section documents such "data types/formats" used in BK for various purposes.

## Types list

[Orders array](ordersarray.md) - specify one or more order instructions on column/direction basis

[Raw results](rawresults.md) - holds multiple records - a subset of a bigger set of records.
