# Declaring interfaces

Interfaces in BindKraft are declared as simple prototype based classes with all methods designed to throws "not implemented" exception. 

Interfaces can carry functionality that will be added to the classes implementing them, but this is **bad practice**! For that purpose there are the [Interface implementers](OOPImplementers.md).
