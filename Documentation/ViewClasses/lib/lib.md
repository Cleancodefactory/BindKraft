# View library

Essential components for view (template) construction.

The classes here should not be perceived as controls. The best way to consider them is to treat them as the components needed to define the basic structure of a template - in a sense they correspond to the basic structures of a programming language e.g:

- _The Repeater, SelectableRepeater, ValueRepeater can be compared to cycle constructs._
- _TemplateSwitcher and DualTemplate play role similar to if ... then or switch ... case structures_
-  _DataArea is a kind of a local context control construct_

Check the examples or corresponding tutorials to get a better understanding of their purpose and use.
