# BindKraftJS - Changes since april 2019

## 2019

### April

2-5: Reorganizing the content for upload in GitHub

11: Version 2.17.5
    Moved the repo to GitHub - directory structure was reorganized to match typical module, so that the repo can be checked out directly into module directory (as sub-module or otherwise) and used by simply including it into the dependency chain.

11: Added property stubbing routine as static method of Delegate.
    Added BaseObject.LASTERROR static method that works just like the instance one.
    Corrected and styled minimally the MainWindow's final fall-back template (in code).

    TODO: update this file - use the release notes.
