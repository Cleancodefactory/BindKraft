# binding source/service attribute

`source` is mutually exclusive with `service` - they both specify the same thing - the source of the data binding or the source on which the event handler is. The `source` supports syntax to do that mostly in the same view and a few special places, while te `service` is responsible for entirely different direction - on based on local service location mechanisms.
