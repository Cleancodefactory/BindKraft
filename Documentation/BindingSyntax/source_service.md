# binding source/service attribute

`Source` is mutually exclusive with `service` and the reason is quite obvious - they both specify the same thing - the source of the data binding. The `source` supports syntax to do that mostly in the same view and a few special places, while te `service` is responsible for entirely different direction - on based on local service location mechanisms.
