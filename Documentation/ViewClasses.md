# View classes and interfaces reference

## General

### Classes

[Base class](ViewClasses/Base.md)

## Geometry helpers

These classes replace the old ones (Point, Rect etc.) from BK core. They are similar and will accept in their methods the deprecated old classes where possible. Interfaces are also introduced in order to make usage of geometry classes more flexible.

Interfaces: IPoint, IRect, ISize see [Geometry helpers](ViewClasses/Geometry.md) for details.

Classes: [GPoint](ViewClasses/GPoint.md) | [GRect](ViewClasses/GRect.md) | [GSize](ViewClasses/GSize.md) | [GSizeLimits](ViewClasses/GSizeLimits.md)

### Implementors

[ICustomParameterizationStdImpl](ViewClasses/ICustomParameterizationStdImpl.md)

### Low level

[DOMUtilFragment](ViewClasses/DOMUtilFragment.md)
