// This directory is deprecated. All the formatters have been moved to the core/formatters.
// This decision may be a bit strange considering that they are usually used in the UI, but
// in fact they are abstract enough for the core and can be used programmaticaly, in which
// case certain UI related parameters can just be skipped. 
// Now, we are going to add some utility functions to support that better.
