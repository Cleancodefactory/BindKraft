Mouse, pointer and touch tracking

This is work in progress. It is guaranteed the code here will not break your 
BindKraft projects if the features implemented are not in actual use. The 
official support will be announced when they mature enough.

When browsing through the source keep in mind that mouse is always used as
an initial proving ground for concepts that should be applied also to other UI
pointer techniques.
