# Servicing

This directory contains base classes or simple implementations related to the `servicing` features. Its content in no way covers the entire feature - it only puts the base over which more specific implementations will be created in other places of the framework and in specific applications and provides implementations for cases where base classes cannot do the job. These are for cases where more complex implementations are not needed or temporary solutions are needed for heavy projects where the full solution can be implemented later.

## What is this `servicing`?

This is a generalization of
