# Foreign communication

__This part is under development and is not ready to use__

## Overview

Foreign calls/communication establishes a transparent communication 
Interface between classes. Through that Interface it does not matter 
where the classes are - in another workspace, in another app etc. 
Of course its features are limited and creation/connection services establish the
connection between the objects.
